# MDdb
MDdb Science Gateway

Research on biology has seen exciting progress with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) computational simulations. An increasingly large volume of MD data is produced daily throughout the world. This trend is expected to grow exponentially with the advent of the exascale era. The lack of a global standard, metadata definitions, tools, and platforms that implement and enforce them has been a significant obstacle to cite, share, find, access, operate, reuse, visualize, or even reproduce MD digital research objects. 

The MDdb project (http://md-db.org) addresses these problems by providing a public Science Gateway based on the FAIR principles and the Resource Description Framework. MDdb hosts information on MD simulations of biomolecules, from data to analytical pipelines. All MDdb entries are assigned a DOI managed on a web server, represented in human and machine-readable formats. Metadata contains detailed provenance and cross-references to well-known identifiers conforming to standards for the chemical and structural biology domains. The DOI resolves to a Graphical User Interface with tools to interpret MD trajectories through interactive visualization.

Life sciences research groups that produce MD simulations are the primary data source. However, all fields with biomolecular interest are direct users. Education institutions at all levels will also benefit from this initiative.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1400 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
